p Adding a fairy to this action is cute and friendly, and also associates the fairies with actions -
  | safe, useful actions. This initial fairy isn't necessary to teach a new person how to do the right action,
  | because that's already so simple that no one could miss it. The first fairy is just to teach people what the
  | fairies do, what you can expect out of them, and that they can be trusted.
